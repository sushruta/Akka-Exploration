# Akka-Exploration
exploring the world of akka. One project at a time

Creating a Project
-------------------

What kind of a project do you want to create? There are three kinds right now -
* usage - write a small project to see how a feature works
* tutorial - write a toy program to see how some features work together
* app - a complete app to see things in action

create a project a running

`./genproj.sh <project_type> <project_directory>`

Adding more libraries
----------------------

As the projects get more advanced, more libraries will need to be added. I will make `genproj.sh` more modular to allow for this.
